# Setup Instructions for UBC ARC Sockeye

**Note:** You have to be either on campus or using UBC VPN before connecting to ARC Sockeye or checking the documentation.

Once you've got an `ssh` supported terminal and connected to UBC network, run
```bash
ssh YOUR_CWL_USERNAME@sockeye.arc.ubc.ca
```
then you'll be asked to enter your password (for your CWL account), and go through MFA.

MFA will be through the options you provide (both through text message and through DUO).
